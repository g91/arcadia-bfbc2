# original message
An experimental project in emulating backend services for Battlefield 1943 (possibly others!). Project is in early development and is not yet playable. 


**Note**: This project is not affiliated with EA or DICE.

## Features

Currently, enough is "implemented" to allow accessing the game's tutorial. When asked to enter email/password, just submit whatever (or keep them empty).

## RPCS3 Client Configuration

1. Enable network connection and RPCN
1. Set IP/Hosts switches to:

```
beach-ps3.fesl.ea.com=127.0.0.1&&theater.ps3.arcadia=127.0.0.1
